# Python datemath-parser
A date match parser to be compatiable with the elasticsearch date math format

# What is date math ?
Similar to the SOLR date math format, elasticsearch has its own built in format for short hand date math.

Documentation from elasticsearch:
http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-date-format.html#date-math

> The date type supports using date math expression when using it in a query/filter (mainly makes sense in range query/filter).

> The expression starts with an "anchor" date, which can be either now or a date string (in the applicable format) ending with `||`.

> It can then follow by a math expression, supporting `+`, `-` and `/` (rounding).

> The units supported are `y` (year), `M` (month), `w` (week), `d` (day), `h` (hour), `m` (minute), and `s` (second).

> Here are some samples: `now+1h`, `now+1h+1m`, `now+1h/d`, `2012-01-01||+1M/d`.

> Note, when doing range type searches, and the upper value is inclusive, the rounding will properly be rounded to the ceiling instead of flooring it.

# Unit Maps
```
y or Y      =   'year'
M           =   'month'
m           =   'minute'
d or D      =   'day'
w           =   'week'
h or H      =   'hour'
s or S      =   'second'
```

# Examples
Assuming our datetime is currently: '2016-01-01T00:00:00-00:00'
```
Expression:                 Result:
now-1h                      2015-12-31T23:00:00+00:00
now-1y                      2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00
now+1y+2d                   2017-01-03T00:00:00+00:00
now+12h                     2016-01-01T12:00:00+00:00
now+1d/d                    2016-01-03T00:00:00+00:00
+2h                         2016-01-01T02:00:00+00:00
+1h/h                       2016-01-01T02:00:00+00:00
now+1w/w                    2016-01-11T00:00:00+00:00
now/d+7d+12h                2016-01-08T12:00:00+00:00
2016-01-01||+1d             2016-01-02T00:00:00+00:00
2015-01-01||+2w             2015-01-15T00:00:00+00:00
```

# Usage
Returns an arrow date object representing your timestamp.  
This can be converted using arrow's ```.format()``` method
```python
>>> import datemath as dm
>>>
>>> dm.parse('now+1h')
<Arrow [2016-01-01T01:00:00+00:00]>
>>> dm.parse('now+1h+1m')
<Arrow [2016-01-01T01:01:00+00:00]>
>>> dm.parse('now+1h/d')
<Arrow [2016-01-02T00:00:00+00:00]>
>>> dm.parse('now-1d')
<Arrow [2015-12-31T00:00:00+00:00]>
>>> dm.parse('2016-01-01||+1/d')
<Arrow [2016-01-02T00:00:00+00:00]>
>>> dm.parse('now/d+2h+3m')
<Arrow [2016-01-01T02:03:00+00:00]>
>>>
```
